This project is a Traffic Light Control System implemented in Python.
It simulates the behavior of traffic lights by managing multiple lanes and switching signals based on a predefined time for each lane.

🔹 Features

Controls multiple traffic lanes

Automatic switching between lanes after a fixed green time

Tracks elapsed time and remaining time for each signal

Simple and modular class-based design

Easy to extend for real-time detection or AI-based control

🔹 How It Works

Each lane gets a green signal for a specific duration

When the time is over, the system switches to the next lane

After the last lane, it loops back to the first lane

Timing is handled using system time

🔹 Technologies Used

Python

Time module

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

🔹 Possible Improvements

Integrate vehicle detection using Computer Vision (YOLO / OpenCV)

Dynamic green time based on traffic density

GUI or real-time visualization

Smart traffic control using AI models

🔹 Use Case

This project can be used as a basic simulation for traffic light systems and as a foundation for smart traffic management applications.
